# Web
Cloud Computing(AWS), Web Development project

Cloud based Diet Recommendation System. It is web based application hosted on AWS. It is serverless computing based application. It uses many of AWS services like Amazon S3, AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, 
Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Lex, AWS IAM, AWS Amplify, Amazon Route 53, Amazon Cloudwatch, etc...
Not responsive, so ui might behave differently on your screen. Currently not active since it was costing me for the services I used in AWS.
